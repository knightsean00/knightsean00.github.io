This personal website was built with React, Sass, and gh-pages. This repo contains
all the source code for the website construction while the 
[deploy branch](https://github.com/knightsean00/knightsean00.github.io/tree/deploy)
contains the static build files.

You can view the old website source code by visiting the old branch.

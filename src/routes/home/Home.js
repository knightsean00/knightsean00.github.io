                        <p>Hi! My name is Sean. I am currently a second-year at MIT studying Computation and Cognition (Course 6-9). Although I have been interested in 
                        computer science for as long as I can remember, studying neuroscience is fairly new to me. I am excited to learn more about the intersection 
                        between the two fields, as well as how each of the fields can inform the other.</p>
                        <p>This past summer, I spent my time conducting research at the <a href="https://quest.mit.edu/">MIT Quest for Intelligence Initiative</a>. Our teamâ€™s goal was 
                            primarily to improve sub-seasonal weather forecasting using machine learning and thereby improve water management.</p>
                        <p>At MIT, I serve as a committee member for the Student Events Board (formerly UA Events) and a member of 
                            logistics and marketing team for <a href="https://hackmit.org/">HackMIT</a>.</p>
                        <p>Aside from my primary field of study, I am also seeking a minor in Business Management and Comparative Media Studies. 
                            In my spare time I can usually be found playing video games or practicing cello/piano. </p>
